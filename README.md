A reimplementation of the instant messaging app seen in Persona 5 for Android using Compose UI.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is _not_ a functioning messaging app. It simulates a single conversation to demonstrate how such an app would be implemented in Compose UI.

Persona 5 has one of the most stylish user interfaces, including its in-game messaging app! This repository attempts to answer what it might look like if it were a real app, and how it could be built for Android.

### Additional Resources

This app was originally made for a presentation at DroidKaigi 2024, with a slightly expanded version given at KotlinConf 2025. For native English speakers the KotlinConf version is probably a more enjoyable watch since I didn't have to slow down for interpretation.

Slides in both English and Japanese can be [found here on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/chrishorner/creative-compose-ui). The slightly longer KotlinConf slides in English [are available here](https://speakerdeck.com/chrishorner/creative-uis-with-compose-kotlinconf-2025). Recordings are up on YouTube:
